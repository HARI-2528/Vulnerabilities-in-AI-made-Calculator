# Vulnerabilities-in-AI-made-Calculator
checking vulnerabilities in ai made calculator program with python
#Tried Le Mistral for the first time ever , tried to make a python calculator with it , with some advanced functions 
soon was going through the program it made , usually i dont proofread but the AI feauture of human word to numerical operations made me do it . 
then found out eval() , my sense suggested the phrase from by school book , 'eval() is not usually preferred due to arbitary code excecution vulnerability'.
so , "This project aims to exploit those vulnerabilities and correct them."
